# Z-Script

- a, Ac, b3, are variables : Implemented 14/6/2017
- 1 and 4.3 are numbers : Implemented 14/6/2017
- ^ / * - + are arithmetic operations : Implemented 14/6/2017
- (a + 1) can bracket expressions : Implemented 14/6/2017
- A := 3.4 sets variables to numbers : Implemented 14/6/2017
- B = 3.4 + a sets variables to equations<br>this means that you can change the variables and it will update B : Implemented 29/6/2017
- 2x implicit multiplication works : Implemented 4/8/2017
- Cannot circular reference itself : Implemented 3/7/2017
- Created REPL, used by calling <tt>repl()</tt> : Implemented 3/7/2017
- Boolean Functions and Values
  - not equal --> var1 != var2 : Implemented 4/7/2017
  - equal to --> var1 == var2 : Implemented 4/7/2017
  - less than --> < : Implemented 5/7/2017
  - less than or equal to --> <= : Implemented 5/7/2017
  - greater than --> > : Implemented 5/7/2017
  - greater than or equal to --> >= : Implemented 5/7/2017
  - and --> and : Implemented 12/8/2017
  - or --> or : Implemented 12/8/2017
  - not --> not : Implemented 12/8/2017
  - True : Implemented 21/7/2017
  - False : Implemented 21/7/2017
- ; is the end of line character used for doing multiline commands on one line : Implemented 21/7/2017
- Events
  - graph x y is the event that graphs the variables x and y. can graph x only as well. If x is vector will graph x and y of x : Implemented 11/8/2017
  - next 100 "next Integer" will calculate the next definitions and replace the old values with the new values. It will also save the values you are traceing so that you can graph them : Implemented 27/7/2017
  - trace x will trace the variable x when you call next for later graphing : Implemented 27/7/2017
##! ! Version 1 only ! !
- [1 a 4+2] are lists, can seperate items using ' ' or ',' : Implemented 21/7/2017
- A = [1 a 4+2] sets variables to lists : Implemented 21/7/2017
